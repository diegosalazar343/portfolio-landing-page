      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I am 24 years old and currently live in <em>Tigard</em> with my girlfriend, her parents, three cats, and one dog. We have been here for about 6 months, but lived in <em>Eugene</em> for 5 years attending the <strong>University of Oregon</strong>. We have been together for over two years and share a chonky 1 year old cat named <strong>Bean</strong>. He weighs approximately 18 pounds and I don't know how he got so big! I am an introvert who loves to take over the dance floor, enjoys dissecting movies, knows random animal facts (due to the fact that I wanted to be a zookeeper at age 7), and spends an embarrassing amount of time on Tik Tok.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>I was born and raised in <em>Orange County, California.</em>. My family consists of my mom, a 22 year old brother, and a 20 year old sister. After highschool, I left for <em>Eugene</em> to attend the <strong>University of Oregon</strong> where I majored in Psychology and minored in Business. In my senior year I didn't know what I wanted to do after college, all I did know was that I didn't want to pursue psychology anymore. So I finished my degree and decided to stay in <em>Eugene</em> figuring out what I want to do while my girlfriend finished her senior year. Because I didn't have any prior job experience the only job that I was able to find was working retail at the Duck Store! The Duck Store was alright and the people that I worked with were nice, but I wasn't being challenged. I still had connections to the University and they recommended that I take a career test. I did and the results recealed that I should consider computer programming so I talked to a friend who currently works in that field and he recommended that I look into bootcamps. I researched for bootcamps near <em>Portland</em> and noticed that Epicodus had some of the best reviews and the more and more I looked into it, the sooner I knew that this program was the one for me.</p>

      <h2>My Hobbies, Interests, and my Skills</h2>
      <hr>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Since we are in the middle of a pandemic my only hobby is gaming, and binging tv shows. The games that I play include Call of Duty, Skyrim, and Fifa. Television shows that I have binged since the pandemic include Breaking Bad, Peaky Blinders, Vikings, New Girl, and Adventure Time. However in the time before Covid, I enjoyed bar hopping with my friends and traveling with my girlfriend</p></li>
        <li><p>I am interested in almost all sports especially soccer. The soccer team that I support is the Tottenham Hotspurs and they break my heart every weekend. If you know anything about English Premier League, then you know how dissapointing the Spurs (nickname for Tottenham) have been. Other things I'm interested in are audiobooks and podcasts. I recently relistened to the entire Harry Potter series and my favorite podcasts include Pardon My Take and The Corp. They are nice to put in the background while you are driving or going for a run. I also recently got into watching gamers stream on twitch, especially Nickmercs.</p></li>
        <li><p>Before starting my journey with <span class="bootcamp">Epicodus</span>, I worked in retail and the skills that I developed from that job included patience, the ability to communicate effectively, and being able to quickly solve problems.</p></li>
      </ul>
