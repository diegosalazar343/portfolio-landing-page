  <h1>All About Diego Salazar!</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Diego and welcome to my first portfolio landing page. In this page I will share with you a little about me, where I'm from, what I'm interested in, and projects that I've accomplished in the past.</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am 24 years old and currently live in Tigard with my girlfriend, her parents, three cats, and one dog. We have been here for about 6 months, but lived in Eugene for 5 years attending the University of Oregon. We have been together for over two years and share a chonky 1 year old cat named Bean. He weighs approximately 18 pounds and I don't know how he got so big! I am an introvert who loves to take over the dance floor, enjoys dissecting movies, knows random animal facts (due to the fact that I wanted to be a zookeeper at age 7), and spends an embarrassing amount of time on Tik Tok.</p>
  <h2>My Background</h2>
  <p>I was born and raised in Orange County, California. My family consists of my mom, a 22 year old brother, and a 20 year old sister. After highschool, I left for Eugene to attend the University of Oregon where I majored in Psychology and minored in Business. In my senior year I didn't know what I wanted to do after college, all I did know was that I didn't want to pursue psychology anymore. So I finished my degree and decided to stay in Eugene figuring out what I want to do while my girlfriend finished her senior year. Because I didn't have any prior job experience the only job that I was able to find was working retail at the Duck Store! The Duck Store was alright and the people that I worked with were nice, but I wasn't being challenged. I still had connections to the University and they recommended that I take a career test. I did and the results recealed that I should consider computer programming so I talked to a friend who currently works in that field and he recommended that I look into bootcamps. I researched for bootcamps near Portland and noticed that Epicodus had some of the best reviews and the more and more I looked into it, the sooner I knew that this program was the one for me.</p>
