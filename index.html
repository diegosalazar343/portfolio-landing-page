  <h1>All About Diego Salazar!</h1>
  <p>Hello! My name is Diego and welcome to my first portfolio landing page. In this page I will share with you a little about me, where I'm from, what I'm interested in, and projects that I've accomplished in the past.</p>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am 24 years old and currently live in Tigard with my girlfriend, her parents, three cats, and one dog. We have been here for about 6 months, but lived in Eugene for 5 years attending the University of Oregon. We have been together for over two years and share a chonky 1 year old cat named Bean. He weighs approximately 18 pounds and I don't know how he got so big! I am an introvert who loves to take over the dance floor, enjoys dissecting movies, knows random animal facts (due to the fact that I wanted to be a zookeeper at age 7), and spends an embarrassing amount of time on Tik Tok.</p>
